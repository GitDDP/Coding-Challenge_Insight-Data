In this coding challenge, I put my source code in the folder"src".I used Java as my programming language.

I used java-json.jar external library for the data parsing purpose. add it to the build path before compiling the code using Eclipse. 

To compile and run the code, please change the directory of the source file "tweets.txt" and output file"output.txt"
I also put "test.txt" as my own test case in the folder "data-gen". Also, an output file "output.txt" for the "tweets.txt" case, an output file "output for test.txt" for the "test.txt". 

Thanks!
